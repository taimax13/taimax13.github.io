        details: |
          Whether it’s personal information, financial data, or sensitive business documents, the need to protect data from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft is paramount. This is the driving force behind the development of ChainGuard (ChaGu)

      - title: Advanced Monitoring with AI and Prometheus - Detecting and Mitigating Memory Leaks (Published also by devops-dev)
        link: "https://medium.com/devops-dev/advanced-monitoring-with-ai-and-prometheus-detecting-and-mitigating-memory-leaks-230c9d64fa30"
        details: |
          Memory leaks occur when a program allocates memory but fails to release it, gradually increasing memory usage over time. Long-running applications can cause the system to run out of memory, resulting in slowdowns or crashes. Detecting these leaks early is crucial for maintaining application performance and avoiding costly downtime.
